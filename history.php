<h4 style="color:white" >Brief history of the jcf</h4> 
 <p>The history of law enforcement in Jamaica began in 1716 when night watchmen were appointed to serve the cities </P>
 <p> of Port Royal, Kingston, and the parishes of Saint Catherine and Saint Andrew. In 1832 the first attempt to </p>
 <p> establish a permanent police force began, and William Ramsay was appointed Inspector General of the police force</p>
 <p> in 1835.</P>
 <br>  
 <p>This force continued in service until 1865, the year of the Morant Bay Rebellion. This uprising demonstrated the <p>
 <p>vulnerability of peace and law on Jamaica and caused the establishment of an improved police force, the Jamaica <p>
 <p>Constabulary Force. The force began operation with 984 members, under the direction of an Inspector General appointed <p>
 <p>by the British Governor to the island, and continues to carry out police duties to the present day.<p>
 <br>
 <p>In July 2014 Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of Operations, Glenmore Hinds was appointed the Acting Commissioner<p>
 <p> of Police following the sudden retirement of Police Commissioner Owen Ellington.[citation needed] In September 2014, the<p>
 <p> Minister of National Security announced the appointment of Deputy Commissioner Carl M. Williams, Ph.D., to become the new<p>
 <p> Commissioner of Police.<p>
 <br>
 <p>In December 2016, Dr. Carl Williams announced that he will be retiring from the Jamaica Constabulary Force effective January<p>
 <p> 6, 2017. The Police Services Commission immediately named Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Novelette P. Grant, JP, MA, M.Sc.<p>
 <p> to act as Commissioner of Police for 90 days effective January 7, 2017. DCP Grant is only female holding one of the four deputy<p>
 <p> commissioner rank in the Jamaica Constabulary Force.<p>
 <br>
 <p>On April 10, 2017, the Police Services Commission announced the appointment of Deputy Commissioner George F. Quallo as the new<p>
 <p> commissioner of police effective April 18th 2017.<p>
 <br>
 <p>On January 26, 2018, Mr. George Quallo announced that he will be retiring from the Jamaica Constabulary Force, he was expected to<p>
 <p> demit office in August 2018.[2] On February 1, 2018, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Clifford Blake to act as Commissioner of<p>
 <p> Police until March 19, 2018 when Major General Antony Anderson will officially be appointed to the post. Major General A. Anderson <p>
 <p>will be the third former JDF head to be appointed as Commissioner of Police.[3][4]The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) is the police <p>
 <p>force of Jamaica. The current head of the JCF is Commissioner</p>
 <p> Major General Antony Anderson. The JCF’s mission is ‘to serve, protect and reassure with courtesy, integrity and</p>
 <p> respect for the rights of all.’ The JCF falls under the authority of the Ministry of National Security.</p>
